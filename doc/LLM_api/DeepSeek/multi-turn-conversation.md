This guide will introduce how to use the DeepSeek /chat/completions API for multi-turn conversations.

The DeepSeek /chat/completions API is a "stateless" API, meaning the server does not record the context of user requests. Users need to concatenate all previous conversation history and pass it to the chat API in each request.

The following code demonstrates, using Python, how to concatenate context to achieve multi-turn conversations.

from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI(api_key="<DeepSeek API Key>", base_url="https://api.deepseek.com")

# Round 1
messages = [{"role": "user", "content": "What's the highest mountain in the world?"}]
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="deepseek-v4-pro",
    messages=messages
)

messages.append(response.choices[0].message)
print(f"Messages Round 1: {messages}")

# Round 2
messages.append({"role": "user", "content": "What is the second?"})
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="deepseek-v4-pro",
    messages=messages
)

messages.append(response.choices[0].message)
print(f"Messages Round 2: {messages}")

In the first round request, the messages passed to the API are:

[
    {"role": "user", "content": "What's the highest mountain in the world?"}
]

In the second round request:

Add the model's output from the first round to the end of messages
Add the new question to the end of messages
The final messages passed to the API are:

[
    {"role": "user", "content": "What's the highest mountain in the world?"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "The highest mountain in the world is Mount Everest."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "What is the second?"}
]
